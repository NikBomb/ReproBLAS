PRBLAS - Parallel Reproducible BLAS v1.0

1. Istallation

In order to compile MPI version, an MPI compiler must be provided in make.inc
Line 12 contains an example for mpicc compiler.

- Download the latest version of source code from
  bebop.cs.berkeley.edu/reproblas/download.html
- Un-compress the downloaded zip or tar file to {PRBLAS_ROOT} folder
- Go to {PRBLAS_ROOT}
- Type make to install the libraries. Alternatively, one can install the
  libraries separately:
    make IndexedFP
    make MPIndexedFP
    make reproblas_seq
    make reproblas_mpi
  compiled libraries reside in sub-directory: {PRBLAS_ROOT}/build/libs
- make check
  check the reproducibility of the compiled library
- make accuracy
  check the accuracy of the provided reproducible BLAS level 1 routines

2. Usage

In order to use the compiled libraries, one of the following header files
must be included:
- IndexedFP.h
- MPIndexedFP.h
- rblas.h
- rblas_mpi.h
These header files can be found in subdirectory {PRBLAS_ROOT}/build/include

The libraries must also be linked in the correct order during linking time:
-lreproblas_mpi -lreproblas_seq -liblas -lmpindexedfp -lindexedfp

Dependency of compiled libraries:

                   libreptroblas_mpi.a
