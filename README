Reproducible BLAS v2.0

Installation:

0.    Download the latest version of source code from
    bebop.cs.berkeley.edu/reproblas/download.html
1.    Un-compress the downloaded zip or tar file to {ReproBLAS_ROOT} folder
2.    Go to {ReproBLAS_ROOT}
3.    Check that all of the settings in config.mk are correct. Most importantly,
    check that the install locations are correct. If you want to use MPI, be
    sure to set the BUILD_MPI flag and to supply the proper MPI compiling and
    linking flags.
4.    Python is recommended for installation. If python is installed, ReproBLAS
    will use code generation during installation. If python is not installed,
    ReproBLAS will use pre-generated files and you can skip to step 7.
5.    If python is installed, first type 'make update'. This will make all of
    the configuration settings available to the python generators.
6.    From {ReproBLAS_ROOT}, type 'make'.
7.    From {ReproBLAS_ROOT}, type 'make install'.
8.    To verify installation, try compiling the examples. From
    {ReproBLAS_ROOT}/examples, type 'make'. Then, run the example with
    './sum_sine'

Documentation:

0.    Read the examples in {ReproBLAS_ROOT}/examples
1.    Browse the installed documentation at the location specified by the
    DOC_DIR variable in config.mk. Your can browse it in website form or as a
    pdf.
2.    Consult the header files in {ReproBLAS_ROOT}/include

Usage:

    ReproBLAS libraries are nested in functionality. What follows is a graph
  where a forward edge represents inclusion:

    libreproBLAS.a
         |
         v
    libidxdBLAS.a  libidxdMPI.a
         |              |
         +-----+  +-----+
               |  |
               v  v
             libidxd.a

    All ReproBLAS libraries require you to link to libm.a. Therefore, your link
  string should include some subset of:
      -lidxd -lidxdBLAS -lreproBLAS -lidxdMPI
    Followed by:
      -lm

Advanced Usage:
  ReproBLAS uses a custom build system. It uses gnu make


- make check
  check the reproducibility of the compiled library
- make accuracy
  check the accuracy of the provided reproducible BLAS level 1 routines
