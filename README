Reproducible BLAS v2.0

Installation:

0.    Download the latest version of source code from
    bebop.cs.berkeley.edu/reproblas/download.html
1.    Un-compress the downloaded zip or tar file to {ReproBLAS_ROOT} folder
2.    Go to {ReproBLAS_ROOT}
3.    Check that all of the settings in config.mk are correct. Most importantly,
    check that the install locations are correct. If you want to use MPI, be
    sure to set the BUILD_MPI flag and to supply the proper MPI compiling and
    linking flags.
4.    Python is recommended for installation. If python is installed, ReproBLAS
    will use code generation during installation. If python is not installed,
    ReproBLAS will use pre-generated files and you can skip to step 7.
5.    If python is installed: from {ReproBLAS_ROOT}, type 'make update'. This
    will make all of the configuration settings available to the python
    generators.
6.    From {ReproBLAS_ROOT}, type 'make'.
7.    From {ReproBLAS_ROOT}, type 'make install'.
8.    To verify installation, try compiling the examples. From
    {ReproBLAS_ROOT}/examples, type 'make'. Then, run the example with
    './sum_sine'

Documentation:

0.    Read the examples in {ReproBLAS_ROOT}/examples
1.    Browse the installed documentation at the location specified by the
    DOC_DIR variable in config.mk. Your can browse it in website form or as a
    pdf. To view the documentation online, visit
    bebob.cs.berkeley.edu/reproblas/index.php
2.    Consult the header files in {ReproBLAS_ROOT}/include

Usage:

    ReproBLAS libraries are nested in functionality. What follows is a graph
  where a forward edge represents inclusion:

    libreproBLAS.a
         |
         v
    libidxdBLAS.a  libidxdMPI.a
         |              |
         +-----+  +-----+
               |  |
               v  v
             libidxd.a

    All ReproBLAS libraries require you to link to libm.a. Therefore, your link
  string should include some subset of:
      -lidxd -lidxdBLAS -lreproBLAS -lidxdMPI
    Followed by:
      -lm

Advanced Usage:
    ReproBLAS uses a custom build system. It is based off of the nonrec-make
  project. The build system encodes information not in the Makefile, but in a
  separate file in each directory called Rules.mk. The default make target
  builds all files in the subtree rooted at the current directory. If you want
  to build all files, type 'make all'. If you want to make just the files in
  the current directory, type 'make dir'. There are corresponding targets
  'clean_tree', 'clean_all', 'clean_dir'. Check {ReproBLAS_ROOT}/config.mk for
  many more options. The make system lives in {ReproBLAS_ROOT}/mk. The built
  files go in {ReproBLAS_ROOT}/build.

    If you have python, you can run the tests. To run the benchmarks, type
  'make bench'. To run the checks, type 'make check'. To run the accuracy test,
  type 'make acc'. By following the example of
  {ReproBLAS_ROOT}/tests/checks/check.py,
  {ReproBLAS_ROOT}/tests/benchs/bench.py,
  and {ReproBLAS_ROOT}/tests/accs/acc.py, the user can build their own tests
  composed of subsets of the available tests in
  {ReproBLAS_ROOT}/tests/checks/checks.py,
  {ReproBLAS_ROOT}/tests/benchs/benchs.py,
  and {ReproBLAS_ROOT}/tests/accs/accs.py.

  Several configuration options are available in {ReproBLAS_ROOT}/config.py,
  {ReproBLAS_ROOT}/config.mk, and {ReproBLAS_ROOT}/config.h.

Frequently Asked Questions:
0.    What is the "fold?":

      The goal of using indexed types is to obtain either more accurate or
    reproducible summation of floating point numbers. In reproducible summation,
    floating point numbers are split into several slices along predefined
    boundaries in the exponent range. The space between two boundaries is called
    a bin. Indexed types are composed of several accumulators, each accumulating
    the slices in a particular bin. The accumulators correspond to the largest
    consecutive nonzero bins seen so far.
      The parameter fold describes how many accumulators are used in the
    indexed types supplied to a subroutine (an indexed type with k accumulators
    is k-fold). The default value for this parameter can be set in config.h. If
    you are unsure of what value to use for fold, we recommend 3. Note that the
    fold of indexed types must be the same for all indexed types that interact
    with each other. Operations on more than one indexed type assume all
    indexed types being operated upon have the same fold. Note that the fold of
    an indexed type may not be changed once the type has been allocated. A
    common use case would be to set the value of fold as a global macro in your
    code and supply it to all indexed functions that you use.

1.    What is the error bound of indexed summation?

      The error bound of the returned indexed sum can be queried for a specific     sum and value for fold using the idxd_dibound or idxd_sibound functions in
    idxd.h. The difference between the true sum T of N floating point numbers
    x_0, ..., x_N-1 and the calculated sum S is approximately bounded by:

      |T - S| < N*2^(W(1 - fold))*max|x_j| + 7E|T|

      where W = DIWIDTH = 40 and E = 2^-53 in double precision and
    W = SIWIDTH = 40 and E = 2^-24 in single precision. For fold >= 3,
    reproducible summation is much more accurate than normal (recursive)
    summation.

2.    How do I sum numbers reproducibly using ReproBLAS?

      Check the examples for several different ways to sum numbers. Some of them
    are more modular than others (what if the numbers aren't in an array?). The     fastest way to sum an array of numbers would be to use one of the following     four methods in reproBLAS.h:
      reproBLAS_dsum
      reproBLAS_ssum
      reproBLAS_zsum
      reproBLAS_csum
