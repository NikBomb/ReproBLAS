\section{Composite Operations}
  \label{sec:compositeops}
  Although several reproducible summation algorithms can be built from the set of primitive operations defined in section \ref{sec:primitiveops}, it may be unclear how these operations can be composed to form such algorithms. What follows are the specifications for common summation-based algorithms in terms of the primitive operations.
  To obtain a general completely reproducible algorithm for summation that is, one must design for reproducibility under both data permutation and reduction tree shape.
  Section \ref{sec:compositeops_reduce} shows how the summation algorithm in Section \ref{sec:primitiveops_sum} may be extended to arbitrary reduction tree shapes. Sections \ref{sec:compositeops_dot}, \ref{sec:compositeops_nrm}, \ref{sec:compositeops_gemv}, and \ref{sec:compositeops_gemm} explain how to obtain reasonably performant reproducible versions of representative operations from the BLAS.
