\section{Introduction}
  The algorithms for summation presented in \cite{repsum} enjoyed the following properties:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item They compute a reproducible sum independent of the order of the summands, how they are assigned to processors, or how they are aligned in memory
    \item They make only basic assumptions about the underlying arithmetic (A subset of IEEE Standard 754-2008)
    \item They scale well as a performance-optimized, non-reproducible
  \end{enumerate}
  Our goal is to extend the algorithms in \cite{repsum}
